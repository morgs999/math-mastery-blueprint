## ABOUT THE BLUEPRINT

Have you ever had your child experience anxiety about Math? This usually comes in many forms. Some behaviors include:

* Understanding the concepts in class but having a hard time getting high marks on quizzes, tests, or exams
* Developing dread or anxiety about written evaluations 
* Your child losing confidence in his/her own Math abilities, which affects his/her self-confidence

The Math Mastery Blueprint (MMB) was designed to help students who may struggle with these experiences. Through setting a solid foundation and building from the ground up, the MMB helps students to:
* Build a strong foundation for their success
* Develop important critical thinking skills in Mathematics
* Develop your child’s confidence and self-esteem in the process


## ABOUT ME

I have been a teacher in Ontario for the past 6 years, with the first four years teaching Grades 6-8, and the last two years teaching Grades 9-11. I’ve been a Math Tutor since 2015, and during the Pandemic, I was able to help hundreds of students find joy in Mathematics again as it was extremely difficult to learn at the time. I focused on small classes and one-on-one guidance, which is the same formula that is going to be applied for this upcoming online course. I have earned a reputation as a Teacher who will do what it takes to guide your child in the right way.

I believe that all students should feel confident about themselves, and the Math Mastery Blueprint is a way to develop and boost this inner confidence that is waiting to spring up in your child.


## THE PROCESS
